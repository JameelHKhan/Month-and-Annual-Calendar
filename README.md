Week 4 assignments from Intro to Java at JHU

Skills: Methods, control structures 

Part 1 (Month.java): This program prompts the user to enter a month (using the digits 1 - 12) and a year (using a four-digit value) and then displays a calendar for that month and year.

Part 2 (Year.java): This program builds off of part one and prompts the user to specify a year (using a four-digit value) and then displays a calendar for each month in that year.
